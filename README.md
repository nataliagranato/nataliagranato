# Nat√°lia Granato
I am a CNCF Ambassador and Docker Captain, contributing to Kubernetes and other open-source software. I transitioned from the education and telemarketing sectors to DevOps and Cloud Native, focusing on continuous improvement, agile software delivery, vulnerability remediation, and the adoption of best practices for provisioning, configuring, and maintaining platforms.

I have extensive experience in CI/CD, collaboration, and experimentation, having assisted public agencies in automating operations, freeing up time for systemic improvements. I promote a culture of collaboration with assertive communication and knowledge sharing.

Currently, as a Site Reliability Engineer, I contribute to building Magalu Cloud, the Brazilian public cloud.
