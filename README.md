# Nat√°lia Granato
Currently, as a Platform Engineer, I contribute to the construction of Magalu Cloud, the Brazilian public cloud.

I am a CNCF Ambassador and contribute to Kubernetes and other open source software. I have extensive experience in migrating applications to containers and packaging for Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, writing technical documentation, collaboration and experimentation.

My focus is mainly on continuous improvement, agile software delivery, vulnerability remediation, automation and adoption of best practices for provisioning, configuration and maintenance of platforms.

I promote a culture of collaboration with assertive communication and knowledge sharing. My mission is to popularize Cloud Native technologies, helping to build communities such as DevOpsDays Belo Horizonte and CNCF Group Juiz de Fora.
